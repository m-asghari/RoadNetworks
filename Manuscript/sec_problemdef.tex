\section{Problem Definition}
\label{sec:problemdef}
Consider a directed and connected transportation network $G(V, E, S)$
consisting of a set of nodes $V$, a set of links $E$ and a probability
distribution $S$ describing the statistics of the link travel times. The
link travel time $c_{ij}^t$ of an edge  $(i,j) ((i,j) \in E, i, j \in V)$ defines the time
it takes a vehicle to traverse the edge when starting at time $t$ at node
$i$. The link travel times are thus time dependent and differ depending on the
arrival time of the vehicle at that edge. Additionally we assume $c_{ij}^t$ to
be a random variable with $f_{ij}^t$ representing its \textit{pdf}. Any two link travel
times may also be correlated. Furthermore, let $p_{sd}$ be a path from node $s$
to node $d$ and $\pi_{sd}$ be the random variable representing the travel time
on $p_{sd}$. The problem considered in this paper is how to obtain the
\textit{pdf} of $\pi_{sd}$ for a given starting time at $s$.

Existing studies so far focused on technical solutions for specific instances of
the above problem. However, to the best of our knowledge none of these studies
has considered the whole pipeline from the raw real-data to the probabilistic
outcome and its evaluation - which poses several additional challenges - nor
where the approaches ever compared to each other in terms of accuracy. To
this end we also see this work as a study on how to evaluate
probabilistic techniques on uncertain data in a real-wold setting in general.
With this paper, we will focus on the following three specific problems: (1)
Obtaining probabilistic predictions for link travel times from real-world
historical and current traffic data, (2) categorization and implementation of
methods for computing the probabilistic path travel time, and (3) modelling adequate
evaluation measurements of the probabilistic outcomes. We elaborate these
problems below.

\textbf{(1) Probabilistic prediction of edge weights:} We
develop approaches that estimate the parameters of correlated uncertain link travel times in a time-dependent road
network under consideration of historical and current data. Specifically, we aim
at obtaining a \textit{pdf} (or \textit{pmf}) representing $c_{ij}^t$ and parameters for
describing the correlation $corr(c_{ij},c_{kl})$ between two edges $(i,j)$ and
$(k,l)$, based on the following data:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The graph of the road network to consider $G(V,E)$.
  \item For each edge $(i,j) \in E$ historical data about the
  link travel time $c_{ij}^t, t \in H = \{-L\phi, (L+1)\phi, \ldots,
  -\phi\}$, where $\phi$ is the smallest considered time unit and $L \in \NN$.
  \item For each edge $(i,j) \in E$ the current link travel time
  $c_{ij}^0$.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{(2) Technical analysis of existing work:} We will review and
classify existing approaches for computing the probabilistic
path travel time $\pi^t_{sd}$ by following three
attributes: a) modeling the link travel times, b) consideration of
time-dependency and c) modeling of correlations. This categorization lateron allows for a detailed evaluation and comparison of approaches considering arbitrary combinations of these characteristics.

\textbf{(3) Evaluation of probabilistic predictions:} The evaluation and
comparison of different approaches has to be carried out with a selected
repertory from the statistical toolbox. The main challenge here is that the
outcome of the methods for a specific starting time $t$ and a path  $p_{sd}$ is a \textit{pdf} over the estimated path travel time $\pi^t_{sd}$. Comparing the outcome with the true travel time over several
trials has the challenge that $\pi^t_{sd}$ differs for different starting times.
We thus propose a statistical test that enables us to evaluate these outcomes.



% \section{Categorization of Approaches} 
% The above problem statement however is very general and the existing works to
% solve this problem each use a specialized model for $S$. Generally they can be
% categorized by the following three attributes: model for the link travel times,
% consideration of time-dependency and modelling of correlations.
% 
% \subsection{Model for Link Travel Times}
% 
% 
% \subsection{Time Dependency}
% Especially in road-networks time-dependency is a crucial feature which allows
% for a much more precise estimation of the overall travel time. This is obvious
% since the conditions of a road network (including density of vehicles, traffic
% jams, construction sites, accidents) may change rapidly and effect the single
% link travel times drastically. Depending on time $t$ of the day the
% travel time $c_{ij}^t$ for a road segment may thus be represented by a
% different \textit{pdf} (e.g. travel time for the same road segment may be represented either by the \textit{pdf} shown in Figure
% \ref{fig:discrete} for Sundays or by the \textit{pdf} shown in Figure
% \ref{fig:traffic} during rush hours on weekdays).

%     \caption{link travel time at rush hour}
%     \label{fig:traffic}
% \end{figure}
% 
% \subsection{Link Travel Time Correlations}
% The last characteristic is the modelling of correlations between link travel
% times. It is possible to treat the link travel times of different road segments
% (edges) as independent random variables. However on a real-world traffic
% network, it might be more realistic to assume correlated link travel times. For
% example if there is a traffic jam on on road segment yielding high travel times
% then it is likely that the subsequent road segment is also jammed and the travel
% time is also high. To model the correlation between random variables, there
% exist several approaches which will be reviewed in the following section.
